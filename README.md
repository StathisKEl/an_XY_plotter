An XY plotter that places an array of a Hall sensor and a strong magnet connected to two pieces of soft iron over specific points on a metal sheet and measures the changes in magnetic induction as the above array is moved from one point to another. From the measurements stored on an SD card, as well as the points of interest stored on the same SD card, useful conclusions can be drawn about the condition of the metal sheet.
